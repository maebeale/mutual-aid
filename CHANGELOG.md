Changelog
=========
This codebase isn't able to strictly adhere to the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) because it doesn't currenty declare a public API.

However, to support upgrade paths for mutual aid groups who've deployed the app, we will use common SemVer practices to communicate the impact of changes in each release.

We're still in the [initial development phase](https://www.jering.tech/articles/semantic-versioning-in-practice#initial-development-phase), so we are versioning releases with these modified rules:
* Major version (0.x.y) -> will remain at 0 until we're ready to release v1.
* Minor version (0.X.y) -> will be incremented to indicate a **breaking** change, something that will require some action on your part in order to upgrade.
* Patch version (0.x.Y) -> incremented whenever we release backward compatible changes, including new features, bugfixes etc.

This changelog also serves to acknowledge the incredible people who've contributed brilliance, effort and being. Their handles are listed under the first release they each  touched. 💗🙏🏾

## [0.1] - 2020-06-04
*DEPRECATED*

This is an MVP that provides ask and offer forms (that stop people from storing everyone's data in public spreadsheets), and provides a way to "match" people.
It's currently in "fully-moderated" mode, but we're working with a few groups to talk about what peer-to-peer could/should look like.
Has a bunch of CRM/admin tracking, etc, too.
