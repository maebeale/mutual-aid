  # Uncomment and remove (or add) items to (from) this list to completely
  # disable/enable plugins globally (so they cannot be used and are never even
  # loaded). Note that if you remove an item from the list, you will not be

  # If you enable this, you should also enable +locale_accessors+ by default
  # (see below).
  #

  # No fallbacks are used by default. To define default fallbacks, uncomment
  # and set the default fallback option value here. A "true" value will use

  # fallback to your +I18n.default_locale+.

  # Uncomment to enable locale_accessors by default on models. A true value
  # will use the locales defined either in

  # If you want something else, pass an array of locales instead.
  #
  config.default_options[:locale_accessors] = true

  # Uncomment to enable fallthrough accessors by default on models. This will
  # allow you to call any method with a suffix like _en or _pt_br, and Mobility
  # will catch the suffix and convert it into a locale in +method_missing+. If
  # you don't need this kind of open-ended fallthrough behavior, it's better
  # to use locale_accessors instead (which define methods) since method_missing
  # is very slow. (You can use both fallthrough and locale accessor plugins
  # together without conflict.)

  # Note: The dirty plugin enables fallthrough_accessors by default.

  # You can also include backend-specific default options. For example, if you
  # want to default to using the text-type translation table with the KeyValue
  # backend, you can set that as a default by uncommenting this line, or change
  # it to :string to default to the string-type translation table instead. (For
  # other backends, this option is ignored.)

### Mobility gives us the following options (per https://dejimata.com/2017/3/3/translating-with-mobility):
# resource.`attributename_[locale abbreviation]` = "foo"
# resource.save!
#
# resource.string_translations (table where most translations will be stored)
# resource.text_translations
#
# To change locales in the console:
# I18n.default_locale # defaults to :en
# Mobility.locale = :es
#
# examples below for translations on a Post model:
# class Post
#   extend Mobility
#   translates :title, type: :string
#   translates :content, type: :string
# end
#
# Post.find_by(title_en: "Mobility")
# #=> #<Post:0x... id: 123 content_en: "Mobility" content_ja: "モビリティ"...>
# Post.find_by(title_ja: "モビリティ")
# #=> #<Post:0x... id: 123 content_en: "Mobility" content_ja: "モビリティ"...>
#
#
# post = Post.first
# translation = post.translations.find do |translation|
#   translation.locale == "en"
# end
# #=> #<PostTranslation:0x... id: 123 locale: "en" ...>
# translation.title
# #=> "Translating with Mobility"
# translation.content
# #=> "In the first real post on this blog..."
#
# post = Post.first
# post.text_translations.find do |translation|
#   translation.key == "title" && translation.value == "Translating with Mobility"
# end
# #=> #<TextTranslation:0x...
#       id: 123
#       locale: "en"
#       key="title"
#       value="Translating with Mobility"
#       ... >
