(This is modified from our beloved [Ruby for Good](https://www.rubyforgood.org) guide.)

# We ‚ô• contributors!
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the Ruby for Good [code of conduct](https://github.com/rubyforgood/code-of-conduct).

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of *anything*, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

## Find issues to work on
We are using GitHub 'Projects' for planning.
We have a series of [project boards](https://github.com/rubyforgood/mutual-aid/projects) with "Story Map" in their name that describe aspects of the site, plus a [Roadmap] board where we track progress and done-ness. Each Story Map project board may have notes at the top that summarize our current status. Below these notes are the issues that we'd like to work on.

Feel free to read the current status and browse the issues. Contact us via issue comments if anything is unclear.

## Claim an issue
Once you've identified something you'd like to work on, its best to comment on the issue and let maintainers know you're looking into it. That way, they can relay any context that might not be obvious or documented.

In any case, go ahead and 'Assign' yourself to the issue (if someone's already assigned, that is likely still fine, just reach out to them if you want to collaborate).

Once you start working on the issue in earnest, please move it into the 'In progress' column on the [Roadmap].

## Setup your development environment
See our [setup guide](setup.md).

## Put together a Pull Request

Here are the basic steps to submit a pull request. Make sure that you're working on an issue in the [Roadmap]‚Äîif the relevant issue doesn't exist, open it!

1. Fork the repo (unless you're a contributor on the project, in which case you can clone it directly) and get it [set up](setup.md).

1. Run the test suite (`bin/rake` or `bin/dev/test`). We only merge pull requests with a passing test suite, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate.

1. Add your code and tests as needed. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, you probably should add a test or many (if you're not sure how, comment and we might able to help)! See [doc/testing.md](testing.md) for some testing tips relevant to this codebase.

1. Ideally (but optionally) run your changes through `Rubocop`, a ruby code linter and `eslint`. We'll hopefully get this step automated soon.

1. Run the test suite again to be sure everything still works.

1. If you think mutual-aid groups using our app need to know about the changes you made, add an entry to the [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md). Reviewing what's already in there will give you a sense of what types of changes need to be documented.

1. Push to your fork (or directly to rubyforgood/mutual-aid) and submit a pull request. Include the issue number (ex. `Resolves #1`) in the PR description.

1. We provide a pull request template; please look over it and fill in any relevant bits. This is intended to give ideas and guidance around what to document and consider, not as a rigid set of rules.

1. Even if there's no real disagreement about a PR, at least one other person on the team needs to look over a PR before merging. The purpose of this review requirement is to ensure shared knowledge of the app and its changes and to take advantage of the benefits of working together changes without any single person being a bottleneck to making progress.

At this point you're waiting on us -- we'll try to respond to your PR quickly. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Use Rails and Vue idioms and helpers
* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, guides, whatever is affected by your contribution

## Lastly...
Bask in the glory that is you! ‚ú®üôèüèæ
