# Setting Up Development

<sub>↩ Back to [README](/README.md)</sub>

This is a Ruby on Rails 6.0 application with Vue + Webpack included.

To get started developing on your machine, you'll need the following tools installed:

* ruby 2.7+, bundler 2+
* node 10+, yarn 1.16+

This project uses webpacker to bundle front end assets, including:

* [vue](https://vuejs.org/) 2+
* [bulma css](https://bulma.io/) 0.8+
* [buefy](https://buefy.org/) 0.8+

## Setting up services

There are two ways to run services in your development environment:

* Use [Docker](#development-with-docker).
* Install local services on your development host:
    * [PostgreSQL 9.5+](#setting-up-postgresql)
    * [Mailcatcher 0.7.1](#setting-up-mailcatcher)

## Ruby and Bundler

The easiest way to manage different installations of Ruby (we think) is with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

1. Follow the installation instructions on the [rbenv repo](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
1. Restart your terminal, then, in the root directory of the repository:
    ```
    rbenv install
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    ```
`rbenv` will handle installing Ruby and switching to it for you when you enter the repo (so no need to worry about your other Ruby installs!).

If you run into a problem where your bundle install says you're on an older version of bundler than what's in the lockfile, run `gem update --system` to update RubyGems, then:
`gem install bundler:[latest-version-you-want]`, e.g. `gem install bundler:2.1.2`

Depending on your system, you might have trouble building the `pg` gem, probably due to a missing `libpq-fe.h`. To get the necessary libraries installed:

* For Mac (Homebrew): `brew install postgresql`
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`
* On Enterprise Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux/Sci Linux): `yum install postgresql-devel`

## Node and Yarn

The easiest way to manage different installations with node.js is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). After following the installation instructions, type `nvm install` to install and run the right version of node.js.

You'll also need Yarn, a package manager for node.js. To install that:

* For Mac (Homebrew): `brew install yarn`
* Debian/Ubuntu:
```
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```
* On Enterprise Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux/Sci Linux):
```
curl --silent --location https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
sudo yum install yarn
```

### Optional Support for asdf-vm

If you would like to use [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage versions of `ruby`, `yarn` and `nodejs`, simply run `asdf install`. This will automatically install the necessary dependencies for you.

## Setting up PostgreSQL

### On OS X
We recommend:

* The [Postgres.app](Postgres.app), or
* Installing with [`homebrew`](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew).

### On Linux
1. Use your favorite package manager, eg:
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
    ```
2. Create a user for use with the mutual-aid app (or for other databases as well, if you like)
    ```
    # Choose a username and replace <username> below.
    # This will prompt for a password, make sure to remember it for later
    sudo -u postgres createuser <username> --pwprompt --createdb --no-superuser --no-createrole
    ```
3. Give the app knowledge of these creds:
    - Create or edit a `.env.local` file at the root of the project (alongside `.env`)
    - Set the following values to match the username and password from above.
    ```
    POSTGRES_USER=username
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD="password"
    ```
    - Note: the "quotes" around password are required if it contains spaces
4. Test the setup by ensuring the following runs without error:
    ```
    bin/rake db:setup
    ```

## Setting up Mailcatcher

You only need mailcatcher if you're doing a lot of work on emails in the development environment.
Without it, emails will be logged in the server log (log/development.log), but mailcatcher makes mailer work SO much easier.

Mailcatcher cannot be bundled, so has to be installed globally:
```
$ gem install mailcatcher
```

Start the mail server with:
```
$ mailcatcher
```
And go to http://localhost:1080/
Mail can be sent through smtp://localhost:1025


## Environment variables

We're using the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem to reference .env files in the main project level of the repo. Check out their README!

You can override any values in `.env` by introducing an `.env.local` file or more targetted files per environment, e.g. `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`.
All of these are already ignored in our repository so its safe to put credentials there (you can also use `chown/chmod` to further secure them).

Remember to configure environment variables in Heroku or wherever you deploy!
Only the development environment uses `.env` files.


## Running the App!

First, make sure local services or docker are running.

Then, to run the app locally:
```
$ bundle && yarn
$ bin/rake db:rebuild_and_seed_dev
$ bin/rails s # or, rails s -p 9000 (or whatever port you want to use that's not the default 3000)
```
And in a separate terminal:
```
$ bin/webpack-dev-server
```

You should now be able to see the app running at http://localhost:3000


## Running tests
See [doc/testing.md](testing.md).


## Note about deprecation warnings.
Ruby 2.7 deprecated some commonly used syntax so our codebase currently spits out a _lot_ of warnings.

It will take some time for all our gems to get caught up, so in the meantime you might consider turning off deprecation warnings.
There are [several ways](https://www.andrewm.codes/posts/hiding-ruby-2-7-deprecation-warnings-in-rails-6-2mil/) to do this.

An alternative to the methods listed in the artice is to create an alias `alias nodep='export RUBYOPT="-W:no-deprecated"'`, giving
you the flexibility to toggle warnings in each terminal session as appropriate.


## Setting up Heroku (and using it for development)

The Rails and webpack processes can be launched with Heroku, if you choose to go that route. You can install Heroku Local using [these instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).


## Setting up other hosting

(If you've done this, please submit a PR so we can include instructions here!)


## Development with Docker

The application includes a pre-configured [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment. This environment includes two containers, which together deploy the application and a postgres database for it to connect to.

To get started using the application with docker,
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

1. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. From within the repository, navigate to the `/docker/development` folder. If you are in the right folder, you will see a file named `docker-compose.yml` and a file named `Makefile`.

1. To setup the database, run `make seed`. This will setup the database and populate it with some seed data, including a root user with the email and password as specified by the `SYSTEM_EMAIL` and `SYSTEM_PASSWORD` environment variables specified in `.env` (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables) if you'd like to customize them).

1. Now you should be able to run `make start`.

1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. If everything went well, the website should appear and be functional. You can sign in using the email and password from above.

1. This docker compose also setups an a `mailcatcher` server, which you can access at `localhost:1080`. All emails will be delivered to mailcatcher, which should allow you to setup user accounts.

**NOTE** Do not use this method in production! This is for **testing & development only** the configuration used with in this docker-compose file is highly insecure and should never be exposed to the public internet.

Note that if you are developing this application, running `make start` a second time after you have made changes may not update the version of the application deployed by `docker-compose`. To ensure that `docker-compose` builds a new image that includes your changes, run `make build` instead.

Also, if you would like `docker-compose` to run in daemon mode (which means that it will exit once the images have been set up and the application starts running) you may use `make startd`. This will not show you any logging output from the application, however, and you will not be able to exit the application directly. To view logs when docker-compose is running in daemon mode, use `make logs`. To stop the application and all its services, run `make stop`.

**NOTE** the application will save its state between successive invocations of `make build`. This means that if you make changes to the database - for example by adding content or users - then those changes will persist the next time you start the application with `make start`. You can wipe all the state of the application and all the services (including the postgres database) attached to it by running `make wipe`. In particular, you may need to do this if you are making breaking changes to the database structure, or if you have corrupted something somehow. However, do be careful, because this will delete **all** the state saved in the application and database - and there is no way to retrieve it. So make sure you back up anything you want to save before running the command.
